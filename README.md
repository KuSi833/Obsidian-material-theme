# Obsidian-material-theme
A theme for Obsidian inspired by the Material and Atom theme.
Only the dark theme is supported.

This theme builds upon the Atom theme: https://github.com/kognise/obsidian-atom

## Modifications
Some aspects which were further modified are:
1. Colours in general are modified to closer resemble the material theme.
2. Only \<h1> is of larger size, while \<h2> till \<h6> are of smaller size yet of different colours to give different meaning.
3. The left workspace ribbon is widened and the icons enlarged. Also the hover colour of the icons is modified.

## Installation
1. Download obsidian.css to your Obsidian vault folder
2. In Obsidian, click Settings -> Plugins make sure `Custom CSS` is enabled
